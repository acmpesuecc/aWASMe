# Week 1 

## Aston's Progress

- Researched about the inner workings WASM and WAT files
- Wrote a couple of basic programs in WAT to familiarize myself with it
- A simple stack machine which decodes WASM-like opcode bytes

### What's next 
- Start writing the C++ engine
- Implement the stacks and a subset of the instructions
